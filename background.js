The first is the quality of the file you are trying to play. Even if we play the file at the highest possible quality, the best we can ever do is the source quality of the file. The second is the quality of your computer and network. We would definitely like to stream every video so it looks as good as possible, but because we need to convert the file as it plays, the process can be quite difficult for your computer and your network! The third is the quality that the Chromecast supports. Even if your computer and network can convert and stream the file at source quality, the Chromecast can only display so much data at a time (I think the max is 1080p, not sure of the bitrate though). If you are streaming and your video quality is set to \"original\" then you're probably at the highest quality we will be able to give you right now :)","Super sorry!

Sometimes these stop Videostream from running :(\n3. Do you mind sending me log files or screenshots of what's going on? It would really help me get stuff figured out!\n4. Try checking in chrome://plugins to make sure that our Native Client is present and enabled!\n\nPlease let me know how this goes!

These tend to block the ports that Videostream uses to connect the remote app to your computer.\nDo you have some sort of antivirus that may have a firewall built in? These block us off. The bottom line here is that we need TCP ports 5556 and 5558 to be open to us in the firewall. I'm not too sure about linux, but there should be some way to let them through.\nDo you have a funky network setup with multiple routers, access points, or a separate modem and router? Make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same device, otherwise they won't be able to find each other.\nMake sure your wifi is set to \"private\" or \"home\"!\nThis is pretty uncommon, but do you have a firewall built in to your router itself? This will definitely cause us some trouble!\nFinally, try restarting your computer, router and Chromecast. Sometimes that's all you need to do to get it working!\n\nApologies and hope we can get this working for you soon!","Yep!

Can you try:\n\n1) Typing chrome://restart into your address bar\n2) Unplug and plug back in your chromecast\n3) Make sure your router has Multicast and SSDP enabled\n4) Restart your router by unplugging it and plugging it back in\n5) If you're currently powering your Chromecast from the TV's USB port, try using the wall adaptor. Some TVs don't give the Chromecast enough power which can lead to issues.\n6)Try running our firewall repair tool: https://github.com/GetVideostream/VideostreamPortFix/releases/download/1.0.6/VideostreamNetworkRepair.exe\n\nIf those don't help try uninstalling the cast extension and using the beta one here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast-beta/dliochdbjfkdbacpmhlcpmleaejidimm?hl=en\n\nAs well, if you open Videostream from the chrome apps launcher can you try using the app menu built into chrome itself?\n\nFinally, some antiviruses stop apps likes ours (but not youtube or Netflix) from communicating properly (especially AVG antivirus!), try disabling any you run and rebooting your computer!\n\nIf none of that works super dooper apologies and email me back!!! This is a cast extension bug we're fighting with :(\n","To cancel our Premium account, go to the \"help\" button in our app. There should be a button there called subscription management.

The way we get the folders together is by making something called a media library and sending it as a list to your phone! This is so we can change the file names into human readable titles (ex. www.itotallydidntpiratethis.com_x264_some_sort_of_show_S1E2.mp4 would be turned into Some sort of show Season 1 Episode 2), as well as generate data to make them easier to organize and find for the computer. A folder browser would be really cool, but because of the way these files are organized, we would likely have to generate the view on your phone, meaning that if you have a really big media library, this can be pretty slow and difficult to do. We're definitely looking into ways to do this better, but with our small team you probably won't be seeing this feature really soon :(","Getting listing by folder working is definitely something we'd like to do but it might be tricky!

One of the best parts of Videostream is our performance optimizations that let nearly any video stream easily to your Chromecast. This transcoding capability is very performance intensive which means that at this point that for the foreseeable future we'll be leveraging the capabilities of PCs to allow for flawless streaming and won't bring that natively to mobile anytime soon.","Sorry! Reddit has been the suckiest for returning data to us lately. We may have time to poke around to see if they've cut api access or anything now they have \"official\" apps, etc. Viddit is a fun, hacky, side project for us that we built because we wanted instant entertainment and we all just get it from reddit anyway and it's super annoying it's been fritzy. It's taking all of us full time to maintain Videostream right now (and if it breaks we don't eat) but we'll try to fix viddit if/when we can. Hope this clears things up! "];

The first is the quality of the file you are trying to play. Even if we play the file at the highest possible quality, the best we can ever do is the source quality of the file. The second is the quality of your computer and network. We would definitely like to stream every video so it looks as good as possible, but because we need to convert the file as it plays, the process can be quite difficult for your computer and your network! The third is the quality that the Chromecast supports. Even if your computer and network can convert and stream the file at source quality, the Chromecast can only display so much data at a time (I think the max is 1080p, not sure of the bitrate though). If you are streaming and your video quality is set to \"original\" then you're probably at the highest quality we will be able to give you right now :)","Super sorry! Our sale ended as you were looking at it I think :/ I can probably still give you Premium at the sale price right now, but the upgrade will be a bit convoluted (we didn't really think to far ahead with this one). Follow this link to purchase Videostream at the sale price: https://www.paypal.me/videostream/24.99USD Once you have done this, you should get a receipt from Paypal. If you can send me a screenshot of this email, and the email address you want upgraded to Premium (Premium is linked to the email you sign into your Chrome browser with if that helps your decision), We can probably upgrade you manually. It may take a while for Premium to take effect though!","Super sorry!

Unfortunately, I don't think Opensubtitles decides what ads are on there, meaning some of them can be pretty invasive and possibly unsafe (I've gotten that one before as well, but not on Opensubtitles). We use their api to grab subtitles from there, meaning we avoid the ads and unsafe stuff. I would probably suggest using uBlock origin (the adblocker I use) when you're on the site. It seems to block pretty much everything! \n ","Wow! Really sorry about that D: Opensubtitles is a community sourced subtitle site, so it's kept running by ads.

These tend to block the ports that Videostream uses to connect the remote app to your computer.\nDo you have some sort of antivirus that may have a firewall built in? These block us off. The bottom line here is that we need TCP ports 5556 and 5558 to be open to us in the firewall. I'm not too sure about linux, but there should be some way to let them through.\nDo you have a funky network setup with multiple routers, access points, or a separate modem and router? Make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same device, otherwise they won't be able to find each other.\nMake sure your wifi is set to \"private\" or \"home\"!\nThis is pretty uncommon, but do you have a firewall built in to your router itself? This will definitely cause us some trouble!\nFinally, try restarting your computer, router and Chromecast. Sometimes that's all you need to do to get it working!\n\nApologies and hope we can get this working for you soon!","Yep!

One of the best parts of Videostream is our performance optimizations that let nearly any video stream easily to your Chromecast.

Reddit has been the suckiest for returning data to us lately. We may have time to poke around to see if they've cut api access or anything now they have \"official\" apps, etc. Viddit is a fun, hacky, side project for us that we built because we wanted instant entertainment and we all just get it from reddit anyway and it's super annoying it's been fritzy. It's taking all of us full time to maintain Videostream right now (and if it breaks we don't eat) but we'll try to fix viddit if/when we can. Hope this clears things up!

We are aware of the bug and are working on a fix, but we're still in the information gathering stage :/  For now I'd probably suggest uninstalling and reinstalling Videostream :(  Do you mind also sending me your phone model, and what version of android you run please?  It would help us out a lot!  Additionally, I'm pretty sure when an app crashes you get an opportunity to send a crash log to the developers (not sure though).  If you see this option, please send it to us!  We'd really appreciate it :D","Super sorry about that!
