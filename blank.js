The first is the quality of the file you are trying to play. Even if we play the file at the highest possible quality, the best we can ever do is the source quality of the file. The second is the quality of your computer and network. We would definitely like to stream every video so it looks as good as possible, but because we need to convert the file as it plays, the process can be quite difficult for your computer and your network! The third is the quality that the Chromecast supports. Even if your computer and network can convert and stream the file at source quality, the Chromecast can only display so much data at a time (I think the max is 1080p, not sure of the bitrate though). If you are streaming and your video quality is set to \"original\" then you're probably at the highest quality we will be able to give you right now :)","Super sorry! Our sale ended as you were looking at it I think :/ I can probably still give you Premium at the sale price right now, but the upgrade will be a bit convoluted (we didn't really think to far ahead with this one). Follow this link to purchase Videostream at the sale price: https://www.paypal.me/videostream/24.99USD Once you have done this, you should get a receipt from Paypal. If you can send me a screenshot of this email, and the email address you want upgraded to Premium (Premium is linked to the email you sign into your Chrome browser with if that helps your decision), We can probably upgrade you manually. It may take a while for Premium to take effect though!","Super sorry!

Unfortunately, I don't think Opensubtitles decides what ads are on there, meaning some of them can be pretty invasive and possibly unsafe (I've gotten that one before as well, but not on Opensubtitles). We use their api to grab subtitles from there, meaning we avoid the ads and unsafe stuff. I would probably suggest using uBlock origin (the adblocker I use) when you're on the site.

These tend to block the ports that Videostream uses to connect the remote app to your computer.\nDo you have some sort of antivirus that may have a firewall built in? These block us off. The bottom line here is that we need TCP ports 5556 and 5558 to be open to us in the firewall. I'm not too sure about linux, but there should be some way to let them through.\nDo you have a funky network setup with multiple routers, access points, or a separate modem and router? Make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same device, otherwise they won't be able to find each other.\nMake sure your wifi is set to \"private\" or \"home\"!\nThis is pretty uncommon, but do you have a firewall built in to your router itself? This will definitely cause us some trouble!\nFinally, try restarting your computer, router and Chromecast. Sometimes that's all you need to do to get it working!\n\nApologies and hope we can get this working for you soon!","Yep!

The way we get the folders together is by making something called a media library and sending it as a list to your phone! This is so we can change the file names into human readable titles (ex. www.itotallydidntpiratethis.com_x264_some_sort_of_show_S1E2.mp4 would be turned into Some sort of show Season 1 Episode 2), as well as generate data to make them easier to organize and find for the computer. A folder browser would be really cool, but because of the way these files are organized, we would likely have to generate the view on your phone, meaning that if you have a really big media library, this can be pretty slow and difficult to do.

This is so we can change the file names into human readable titles (ex. www.itotallydidntpiratethis.com_x264_some_sort_of_show_S1E2.mp4 would be turned into Some sort of show Season 1 Episode 2), as well as generate data to make them easier to organize and find for the computer. A folder browser would be really cool, but because of the way these files are organized, we would likely have to generate the view on your phone, meaning that if you have a really big media library, this can be pretty slow and difficult to do.

We may have time to poke around to see if they've cut api access or anything now they have \"official\" apps, etc. Viddit is a fun, hacky, side project for us that we built because we wanted instant entertainment and we all just get it from reddit anyway and it's super annoying it's been fritzy.

To solve firewall issues for Mac check out this handy support link: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642\n\n2. In the Advanced Settings -> Allowing Specific Applications section, add Chrome so that Videostream network connections can work.\n\n3. Also do you have any additional Antivirus software, VPN, or firewalls on your Mac or router?\n\n4. Do you live in an apartment building or near lots of other neighbours (and their routers)? Sometimes Wifi interference can be a big issue, try using this app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en) to see if your network is running on the same channel as a lot of other local networks. If so, then changing to a less used channel may help a lot!\n\n5. Finally, do you use Chrome on multiple user accounts or use two versions of Chrome? Videostream can only be running on one instance of Chrome per computer. If you have multiple accounts try making sure Chrome is fully quit or completely logging out when switching users. If you're using multiple versions of Chrome try uninstalling Videostream from the versions you don't regularly use so that Videostream is only installed and running on one version of Chrome.\n\nPlease let me know if that helps!\nCheers!","Super sorry you're having firewall issues!

These tend to block the ports that Videostream uses to connect the remote app to your computer.\n- Have you tried our firewall repair tool? https://github.com/GetVideostream/VideostreamPortFix/releases/download/1.0.5/VideostreamNetworkRepair.exe\n- The firewall utility (above) only fixes windows defender and firewalls that copy its preferences (about half of them) do you run any other firewall? If you do we need TCP ports 5556 and 5558 open! Also check to make sure any antivirus you run doesn't also package in a firewall, they're tricky like that ;) I can help if you let me know which antivirus and firewall you have installed :)\n- Do you have a funky network setup with multiple routers, access points, or a separate modem and router? Make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same device, otherwise they won't be able to find each other.\n- Make sure your wifi is set to \"private\" or \"home\"!\n- Finally, try restarting your computer, router and Chromecast. Sometimes that's all you need to do to get it working!\n\nApologies and hope we can get this working for you soon!

Super sorry about this! We unfortunately can't really do that :/ Our Paypal is set up to receive US Dollars, and going to Premium is unfortunately automated :/ We originally had it set up like this because most of our userbase was in the US so we wanted to let them pay in a familiar currency. Then more people around the world started using Videostream and everybody's currencies tanked .__. Fixing stuff like this is definitely on our roadmap but we've got a few things with our core product we'd still like to get working better first! For now though, if you'd still like to support us but are getting destroyed by the exchange (I'm not sure about the conversion rates right now), we have sales pretty much monthly :) I'd suggest just keeping on the lookout for an upswing!\n\nCheers from Canada!","Really glad to hear you're enjoying Videostream!

If you do we need TCP ports 5556 and 5558 open! Also check to make sure any antivirus you run doesn't also package in a firewall, they're tricky like that ;) I can help if you let me know which antivirus and firewall you have installed :)\n- Do you have a funky network setup with multiple routers, access points, or a separate modem and router? Make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same device, otherwise they won't be able to find each other.\n- Make sure your wifi is set to \"private\" or \"home\"!\n- Finally, try restarting your computer, router and Chromecast. Sometimes that's all you need to do to get it working!\n\nApologies and hope we can get this working for you soon! If this stuff doesn't help, do you mind sending me screenshots of what you're seeing on your phone, as well as what phone you have and what version of android you are running please?

Some routers have firewalls built into them that we can't do anything about! You should be able to disable them in your router settings! \n\n- Try restarting your chromecast,computer, and router! I know this is the standard tech support thing but it seems to work pretty well :) \n\nFinally, do you use Chrome on multiple user accounts or use two versions of Chrome? Videostream can only be running on one instance of Chrome per computer. If you have multiple accounts try making sure Chrome is fully quit or completely logging out when switching users. If you're using multiple versions of Chrome try uninstalling Videostream from the versions you don't regularly use so that Videostream is only installed and running on one version of Chrome. \n\nLet me know how this stuff goes! If it still doesn't work, do you mind sending me screenshots of what you're seeing, as well as a log file please? They would help me out a lot!","Super sorry about that! The firewall popup usually happens if we lose connection to the ports we need on your router for a certain time period. Unfortunately if the firewall is off, this could be any number of things :/ Do you mind trying this stuff?\n\n- I know you said your firewall is off, but do you mind giving our repair tool a shot anyway please? https://github.com/GetVideostream/VideostreamPortFix/releases/download/1.0.5/VideostreamNetworkRepair.exe\n\n- What other firewall/antivirus do you run besides windows defender? We need inbound TCP ports 5556 and 5558 open, some instructions are here: http://community.getvideostream.com/topic/6/developer-post-videostream-freezes-the-tab-antivirus-firewall-help Sometimes your antivirus can update and cut us off from the ports we need due to new definitions\n\n- Also make sure your wifi is set to private or \"home\" and not public!\n\n- Do you live in an apartment building or near lots of other neighbours (and their routers)?

Click on the Chrome menu in the upper right of your browser window.\n2. Click on Settings\n3. Click on the button to Sign into Chrome\n4. Sign in to Chrome with the same account you were logged into Chrome with when you purchased Premium!\n\nIf this doesn't work I have a few suggestions: Go into the buy premium menu and click already have premium. If that doesn't work, log out of Chrome and back in! Finally, If that doesn't work, try restarting your computer/uninstalling/reinstalling the app.\n\nWhen premium is activated, the Videostream logo in the top left corner of the app should be replaced with Videostream Premium!\n\nLet me know if that helps :D","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Super sorry about that :/ There seems to be a bug that's stopping Media Library support on Chromebooks from working for us :/ We're trying to work around it, but the bug unfortunately seems to be in ChromeOS so I don't think there's much we'll be able to do except let Google know and hope it gets fixed :( I know this isn't a great solution but if you have another computer somewhere in the house maybe try using that one?\n\nReally sorry for the inconvenience!","Really sorry about that :( Don't worry if you can't make this sale.

Not sure about this one :/ I feel like the Videostream notifications not working might be a bug for certain android phones though! We tend to have trouble with Samsungs mainly.

Try going into settings and making sure Videostream has the \"Contacts\" permission.\n4. Try restarting your phone and Chromecast\n5.

Firewall troubles can be a pain to fix, especially if they keep popping up!\nHere's some things that should help:\n- Have you tried downloading and running our new repair tool? https://github.com/GetVideostream/VideostreamPortFix/releases/download/1.0.6/VideostreamNetworkRepair.exe If this doesn't work, you could also try going into your Window's firewall settings and allowing Videostream, as well as Chrome through your firewall!\n- What other firewall/antivirus do you run besides windows defender? We need inbound TCP ports 5556 and 5558 open, some instructions are here: http://community.getvideostream.com/topic/6/developer-post-videostream-freezes-the-tab-antivirus-firewall-help\n- Also make sure your wifi is set to private or \"home\" and not public!\n- Do you run any other programs that might be blocking ports 5556 and 5558? I know Teamviewer does (found that one out the hard way)!\n- Do you live in an apartment building or near lots of other neighbours (and their routers)? Sometimes Wifi interference can be a big issue, try using this app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en) to see if your network is running on the same channel as a lot of other local networks. If so, then changing to a less used channel may help a lot!\n- Finally, do you use Chrome on multiple user accounts or use two versions of Chrome? Videostream can only be running on one instance of Chrome per computer. If you have multiple accounts try making sure Chrome is fully quit or completely logging out when switching users. If you're using multiple versions of Chrome try uninstalling Videostream from the versions you don't regularly use so that Videostream is only installed and running on one version of Chrome.\n\nLet me know how this stuff goes! Firewall issues can be a pain but we'll get it sorted out!\n\nApologies!","Super sorry to hear about that!
